# node-mysql-crud-example
### Example of DB CRUD web using NodeJS, MySql, Knex and Bookshelf

This app has been built based on [this tutorial](https://dev.to/achowba/build-a-simple-app-using-node-js-and-mysql-19me), originally on the *master* branch. On the _bookshelf_ branch the code related to database has been adapted to that ORM.

After cloning the repo, you can start the app by:

```shell
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```

Open on a browser `http://localhost:4000/players/` to start ussing the app.

Opening `http://localhost:4000/assets/img/diego.jpeg` you can access directly to the players' images.
